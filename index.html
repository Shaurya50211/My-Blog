					Since 1985, it is crowned with a huge television antenna measuring 62 meters high (22 fl oors)</p>

				<p>Saw it today I loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot. There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

				<p>"The Polar Express" has the quality of a lot of lasting children's entertainment: It's a little creepy. Not creepy in an unpleasant way, but in that sneaky, teasing way that lets you know eerie things could happen. There's a deeper, shivery tone, instead of the mindless jolliness of the usual Christmas movie. This one creates a world of its own, like "The Wizard of Oz" or "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," in which the wise child does not feel too complacent. I also appriciate it's animations because they were very realistic!</p>

				<p> An all-timer of a Christmas heel. He stole the holiday simply because he hated the noise. That’s it. His heart was two sizes too small. End of story. There’s a simple lesson to be learned from Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas when that’s all there is to it, but as Illumination’s The Grinch proves it’s a lesson that gets muddier the more you try to explain it.
					Entire generations have grown up with the story so the film doesn’t have too many surprises. The Grinch lives alone and angry in a Whoville-adjacent cave while the Whos that live in the town below are loving and merry each and every Christmas. For 53 years The Grinch sat in his cave hating it until finally deciding to literally steal Christmas from The Whos. In the end, moved by the Whos’ persistent Christmas spirit even after his holiday heist, the Grinch has a change of heart and returns the gifts.

But when she's sick, all she can do is lie in her bed. Looks like it's time for this sick kitty to go... to the vet.
